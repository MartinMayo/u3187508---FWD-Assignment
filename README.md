# u3187508---FWD-Assignment
This is my assignment. The first folder contains the html sketch assignment.
The second folder contains the CSS sketch assignment. Please ignore the first folder, as all the html coding and assets were copied over to the second folder.
The third folder contains the elements for the Front-end Website Project. There are three different html pages, and a single CSS page that contains the coding for the decoration styles for all three pages. A rationale of my thoughts on the project are also included in the folder.
